what has led to
the public debate
over h- 1bvisa?
last weekend, tech billionaire elon
musk got involved in a public dispute
over the h- 1b visa programme that
allows us employers to hire foreign
workers. musk, who is a key supporter
of president- elect donald trump,
defended the h- 1bvisa saying he could
go to war for it. he was responding to
criticism from far- right activists and
trump supporters over the latter' s
capitalist sriram krishnan as senior
policy advisor on artificial intelligence.
it stirred a debate around immigration
policies. laura loomer, a political
activist, cited krishnan' s past support
for legal immigration and easing
procedures for the entry of skilled
workers into the us, while steve
bannon, a long time aide of trump,
blamed" big tech oligarchs" for
supporting h- 1b visa. trump backed
musk later, saying he was in favour of
" unfair' for local workers. the war of
words has divided trump' s support
base with musk and some other tech
billionaires in favour of h- 1bvisa and
hardliners against it.
musk, who has held a h- 1bvisa himself,
softened his position days later, saying
that the programme is" broken" and
" needs major reform" he also suggested
and adding a yearly cost for maintaining
the h- 1b, making it materially more

face- off
why trump' s base
is split on h- 1b visa
a public row has erupted among donald trump' s
supporters over the h- 1bvisa, whose biggest beneficiaries
are indian nationals. fe explains the issues at the heart of.
the dispute, the criticism faced by the scheme, and how
proposed changes could impact indian it companies
expensive to hire from overseas than
domestically" although musk had argued
skilled" professionals from abroad and the
" top~ 0. 1% of engineering talent, some
hardliners including loomer cited data to

suggest the contrary- that us employers
were hiring thousands of relatively low( it) and financial services sectors. musk
acknowleged that the majority of h- 1b
visa holders earned less than or similar to

72%
of overall
h- 1bvisas were
issued to indian
nationals in
fy2023
proposed changes
in ongoing debate
in the us include
increase in
minimum wage
requirement and
additional fees
$ 60, 000
currently the
minimum annual
wage requirement
under h- 1bvisa
programme

criticism and what the data says
critics of the h- 1bvisaargue that the
scheme undermines american workers.
while tech leaders who are part of
trump' s support base have backed the
visa programme, the detractors have
questioned the claim of a dearth of local
talent. instead, critics view the problem
american talent as too expensive. data
shows the criticism is not entirely
unfounded. according to an analysis of
us citizenship and immigration services
( uscis data obtained by bloomberg,
69% of approvals for indian workers in
how changes
could affect
indian it firms
india is the biggest beneficiary of the
latest figures for fy23 showing that
72% of the visas were issued to indian
nationals. indian it firms gain the
most from the visa, initially granted
for three years but can be extended up
to six years. if the ongoing row in the
us amid the nativist anger directed at
indians leads to proposed changes
such as increase in minimum wage
requirements( currently at$ 60, 000)
or additional fees could lead to a
permanent shift in cost structures for
indian it companies, fe reported.
financial costs relating to wages, and
including increased compliance
burden, may have to be factored in.
also, changed norms could make the
companies rethink their work force
strategies in the us, and they may set
up operations in places like canada or
mexico to service american clients

fy23 were for annual salaries below
$ 100, o00( for it professionals in the us,
the figure was$ 104, 420). in fy23, the
median annual income of people
was$ 118, 000. the corresponding
income for people in computer and
mathematical occupations in the us is
about$ 113, 000. the vast majority of
approvals is for workers in science,
technology, engineering, and maths65% were for computer related jobs in
fy2023. h- 1bvisasaren' t hindering the
rest of the workforce, experts point out.
a tightrope
walk for trump
efforts have been made earlier to
restrict the h- 1bvisa programme.
during trump' s first presidential term,
american, hire american" executive
order increased scrutiny of h- 1bvisa
applications- with denial rates jumping
to 24% in 2018 compared to 5- 8%
during the obama years. trump has
since taken a u- turn. tesla, which is
headed by musk- a big donor for
trump' selection campaign- had724
h- 1b visa holders the last year alone.
although companies and insiders do
not anticipate big changes to the h- 1b
visa or green cards under trump, he
faces a tightrope walk keeping his flock
of backers in silicon valley as well as his
anti- immigration republican party
the debate on h- 1b visa could likely
have a bearing on america' s position in
identity of the grand old party itself.
